					<h3 class="about-question">
						What's the purpose of this website?
					</h3>
					<p class="about-answer"> 
						The main purpose of toriizuka.com is to show facts about Jun Torii and Agnes Iizuka that cannot be shown on LinkedIn. toriizuka.com is used as an extension of LinkedIn and displays information in a more fashionable design. toriizuka.com is also a project that displays Torii's web development skills and helps Torii understand how to start a website from scratch.
					</p>

					<h3 class="about-question">
						Why do some images and text seem out of place?
					</h3>
					<p class="about-answer">
						Currently, the website has been tested only on the Mac version of Firefox 26.0. I have seen some obvious visual issues on the latest version of Safari and some minor issues on the latest version of Chrome. There is no intention of optimizing the website for Internet Explorer (too much effort to use a VM or test on a seperate PC computer). Issues can be reported on <a href="https://github.com/JMtorii/toriizuka-web/issues?milestone=&page=1&state=open">Github</a>.
					</p>

					<h3 class="about-question">
						Is there a mobile version of the website?
					</h3>
					<p class="about-answer">
						Unfortunately not, but there are some future goals to make the website more user-friendly on mobile web browsers.
					</p>

					<h3 class="about-question">
						What are the future plans for the website?
					</h3>
					<p class="about-answer">
						Future goals and milestones can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/JMtorii/toriizuka-web/issues?milestone=&page=1&state=open">Github</a>. Simply filter based on milestones to see what issues are being worked on and by when.
